Bill Ferrell and I came came up with a great idea. We observed that, in today's world, we're bombarded with requests. 
Further, there really are only 4 common words that can answer every request. I built Clarity Keyboard to facilitate that process.

Clarity Keyboard allows you to use and combine those 4 simple words in a rapid fashion. 
Indeed, when you switch to the clarity keyboard, your entire life becomes simplified. 
The clarity keyboard shifts your mindset from being bogged down and busy to feeling productive and happy. You're making decisions in 1/4 the time!

Visit [typewithfuckingclariy.com](http://www.typewithfuckingclarity.com) and enjoy!

Even if you dislike the keyboard, visit the website to show your support.
