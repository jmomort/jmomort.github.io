Visualizing the impact of a budget and investments in the long term was difficult for me. I put together a small website that attempts to show that: <http://blabr.io/?2efbdcc151a2e3e57d75>

In short, the website shows a plot of income, expenses, and net worth over time with sliders and small tables to specify basic assumptions about a budget, future goals, and retirement spending.

The website is entirely open source, its code is at the bottom of the page, and it runs client side. 
It leverages a scientific education platform called <http://blabr.io/> that was really cool to use.

Future items I'd like to add:

  - Better Taxation Rules
  - Specific asset classes and investment accounts with associated taxation, withdraw limits, and contribution limits
  - Investment allocation strategy with a changing risk profile and tax conscious account allocation
  - Social security income
  - Highlighting the "important" factors (i.e., the ones that impact the plot the most)
  - A probabilistic simulation to get a better result estimate (i.e., confidence intervals)
